# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Flux Standard Endpoint
# Status: completed
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the standard Flux endpoint that consolidates fal-ai/flux-lora, rundiffusion-photo-flux, and generate-image-rundiffusion-lora functionality.
# Details:
Create a new endpoint at `POST /api:v2/flux/standard` with the following implementation:

1. Accept input parameters as specified in PRD section 4.2.A
2. Validate input parameters, especially LoRA count (max 2)
3. Fetch LoRA URLs from database based on provided IDs
4. Build enhanced prompt with seed and negative prompt using utility function
5. Call Fal.ai API with properly mapped parameters
6. Store generation record in generation_history_v2 table
7. Return standardized response with request_id, generation_id, and status

Implementation should follow the XanoScript provided in the PRD, with additional error handling and input validation. Ensure the endpoint respects the non-functional requirements for performance and reliability.

# Test Strategy:
Test the endpoint with various input combinations:
- Valid prompt with no LoRAs
- Valid prompt with 1 LoRA
- Valid prompt with 2 LoRAs
- Invalid input with 3+ LoRAs (should return error)
- Test with various seed values (positive, -1, null)
- Test with and without negative prompts
- Verify database record creation
- Verify proper error handling for invalid inputs and API failures
- Test performance under load to ensure it meets the <500ms response time requirement
