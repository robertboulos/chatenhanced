# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Generation History Endpoint
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create an endpoint to retrieve and manage generation history.
# Details:
Create a new endpoint at `GET /api:v2/data/history` with the following implementation:

1. Accept query parameters for filtering (date range, status, provider)
2. Accept pagination parameters (page, limit)
3. Retrieve generation records from the database
4. Return formatted response with generation history

Also implement a `DELETE /api:v2/data/history/:id` endpoint to allow users to delete specific generation records. Include proper authentication and authorization to ensure users can only access their own generation history.

# Test Strategy:
Test the endpoint with various scenarios:
- Retrieve history with different filters
- Test pagination
- Test with no results
- Test deletion of records
- Verify authentication and authorization
- Test with invalid parameters
- Verify proper error handling
- Test performance with large history datasets
