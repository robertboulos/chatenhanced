# Task ID: 20
# Title: Implement Migration Tools and Monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create tools to facilitate migration from v1 to v2 and monitor adoption.
# Details:
Implement the following migration tools and monitoring:

1. Request translator that converts v1 API calls to v2 format
2. Response translator that converts v2 responses to v1 format for backward compatibility
3. Usage dashboard showing v1 vs v2 adoption rates
4. Error monitoring specifically for migration-related issues
5. Automated notifications for users still using v1 endpoints

The migration tools should make it as easy as possible for users to switch from v1 to v2. The monitoring should provide visibility into the migration progress and identify any issues that need to be addressed.

# Test Strategy:
Test the migration tools with various scenarios:
- Convert v1 requests to v2 format
- Convert v2 responses to v1 format
- Test with edge cases and invalid inputs
- Verify that the usage dashboard accurately reflects adoption
- Verify that error monitoring catches migration-related issues
- Test automated notifications
- Get feedback from users on the migration experience
