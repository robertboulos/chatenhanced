# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement LoRA Compatibility Checker
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3
# Priority: low
# Description: Create an endpoint to check compatibility between multiple LoRAs before generation.
# Details:
Create a new endpoint at `POST /api:v2/utils/compatibility` with the following implementation:

1. Accept an array of LoRA IDs to check
2. Retrieve LoRA records from the database
3. Check for known compatibility issues between the LoRAs
4. Return compatibility score and any warnings

Implement a compatibility matrix or algorithm that identifies potential conflicts between LoRAs. This could be based on tags, categories, or historical data on successful/failed combinations. Store compatibility data in a new database table if necessary.

# Test Strategy:
Test the endpoint with various LoRA combinations:
- Known compatible LoRAs
- Known incompatible LoRAs
- Mix of compatible and incompatible LoRAs
- Invalid LoRA IDs
- Verify that compatibility scores are consistent
- Verify that warnings are appropriate
- Test performance under load
