# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Usage Analytics Endpoint
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: low
# Description: Create an endpoint to retrieve usage analytics data.
# Details:
Create a new endpoint at `GET /api:v2/data/analytics` with the following implementation:

1. Accept query parameters for filtering (date range, provider)
2. Calculate usage metrics from generation history
3. Return formatted response with analytics data

The analytics should include:
- Total generations by provider
- Success/failure rates
- Average generation time
- Cost metrics
- Popular LoRA combinations
- Usage trends over time

Implement proper authentication and authorization to ensure users can only access their own analytics unless they have admin privileges.

# Test Strategy:
Test the endpoint with various scenarios:
- Retrieve analytics with different filters
- Test with no data
- Verify calculation accuracy
- Verify authentication and authorization
- Test with invalid parameters
- Verify proper error handling
- Test performance with large datasets
