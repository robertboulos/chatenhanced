# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Universal Status Checker
# Status: completed
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a single endpoint to check status across all async providers.
# Details:
Create a new endpoint at `GET /api:v2/status/check` with the following implementation:

1. Accept request_id and/or generation_id as query parameters
2. Retrieve the generation record from the database
3. If already completed, return the completed response
4. Otherwise, check status with the appropriate provider
5. Update the generation record if completed
6. Return standardized status response

Implement the check_status function as specified in PRD section 4.2.C. Create helper functions for provider-specific status checking (checkProviderStatus) and response formatting (formatStatusResponse, formatCompletedResponse). Handle different provider response formats and ensure consistent output format regardless of provider.

# Test Strategy:
Test the endpoint with various scenarios:
- Check status of pending generation
- Check status of completed generation
- Check status of failed generation
- Test with invalid request_id/generation_id
- Test with different providers (Fal.ai, Replicate)
- Verify database record updates
- Verify proper error handling
- Test performance under load to ensure it meets the <200ms response time requirement
