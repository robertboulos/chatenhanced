# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Testing Suite
# Status: pending

# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive testing suite for all endpoints and functionality.
# Details:
Implement a comprehensive testing suite that includes:

1. Unit tests for all utility functions
2. Integration tests for all endpoints
3. Load tests for performance validation
4. Error handling tests
5. Provider failover tests
6. Database operation tests

The testing suite should be automated and runnable in CI/CD pipelines. Include test coverage reporting and performance benchmarking. Tests should validate both functional requirements (correct behavior) and non-functional requirements (performance, reliability).

# Test Strategy:
Meta-testing of the test suite itself:
- Verify that all endpoints have tests
- Verify that all error conditions are tested
- Verify that performance tests accurately measure response times
- Verify that test coverage is adequate (>80%)
- Run the full test suite and fix any failures
- Verify that the test suite can be run in CI/CD
