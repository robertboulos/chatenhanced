# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement API Documentation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive API documentation for all endpoints.
# Details:
Create OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all endpoints in the Image Generation v2 API group. The documentation should include:

1. Endpoint descriptions
2. Request parameters with types and constraints
3. Response schemas with examples
4. Error codes and messages
5. Authentication requirements
6. Rate limiting information

Also create a migration guide from v1 to v2, highlighting the differences and benefits of the new API. Include code examples in at least 5 programming languages (JavaScript, Python, PHP, Ruby, Go).

# Test Strategy:
Review documentation for accuracy and completeness:
- Verify that all endpoints are documented
- Verify that parameter descriptions are accurate
- Verify that response schemas match actual responses
- Test code examples to ensure they work
- Have developers review the documentation for clarity
- Test the migration guide with v1 users
